One of the code golf leagues of all time, the ACGA announces its inaugural 2024 season to start in only a few days' time. The rules are simple: complete
the challenges (all 18 of 'em) for prizes that don't exist and kudos that aren't at all professionally valuable. You could say you'd put the PRO in "PROgrammer"
or in "PROduction," but let's face it: those aren't the jokes. These challenges will offer your more lulz than you thought possible which were probably none
in the first place. These tasks are hard and that's why we do them.

## Are there any prizes?

Nope.

## Can I put this on my LinkedIn?

Only if you want to be laughed at.

## Great. How do I sign up?
