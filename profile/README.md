One of the code golf leagues of all time, the ACGA announces its inaugural season to start in Spring 2024. The rules are simple: complete
the challenges (all 18 of 'em) for prizes that don't exist and kudos that aren't at all professionally valuable. You could say you'd put the PRO in "PROgrammer"
or in "PROduction," but let's face it: those aren't the jokes. These challenges will offer your more lulz than you thought possible which were probably none
in the first place. 

## What is Code Golf?

The easiest way to answer this question is to do what all very online people do, and cite [Wikipedia's entry on the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf):

> Code golf is a type of recreational computer programming competition in which participants strive to achieve the shortest possible source code that solves a certain problem. Code golf challenges and tournaments may also be named with the programming language used (for example, Perl golf).

## FAQ

### Can I submit my entry multiple times?

Rounds are governed by time, not attempts. As long as your best effort is in by ðŸ•™ 23:59 (EST) on the day
the round ends, it's the latest entry that counts.

### How do I see my score?

#### On your machine

You'll need to

`python -m pip install gatorgrade`

to get the automated grading system (AGS) that we use to run our tests. Once you've done that, type:

`gatorgrade`

to run the grader. The score should be the top line in the readout.

#### On GitHub

You'll need to head to `Settings` and enable GitHub Actions on your fork. This will run the workflows
already built in the repositories and add your stroke count to the Job Summary for a given GitHub Actions
run.

### Are there any prizes?

Nope. The tasks are all made up and the points aren't real.

### Can I put this on my LinkedIn?

Only if you want to be laughed at.

### Great. How do I sign up?
