One of the code golf leagues of all time, the ACGA announces its inaugural season to start in Spring 2024. The rules are simple: complete
the challenges (all 18 of 'em) for prizes that don't exist and kudos that aren't at all professionally valuable. You could say you'd put the PRO in "PROgrammer"
or in "PROduction," but let's face it: those aren't the jokes. These challenges will offer your more lulz than you thought possible which were probably none
in the first place. 

## What is Code Golf?

The easiest way to answer this question is do what all very online people do--quote Wikipedia:

> Code golf is a type of recreational computer programming competition in which participants strive to achieve the shortest possible source code that solves a certain problem. Code golf challenges and tournaments may also be named with the programming language used (for example, Perl golf).

Only if you want to be laughed at.
